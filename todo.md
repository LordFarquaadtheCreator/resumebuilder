# TODO
- [x] webscraper
    - this will be difficult to do since job sites will check if you're human
    - will have to resort to user given job desc
- [x] "repository" of stored words for frequency analysis
    - for testing purposes it's a static list
    - must consider if we need to have multiple databases of it to decrease lookup time
    - large lists are not scalable
- [x] regex to match all counts of frequent words
- [ ] research opposition: https://www.wonsulting.com/services
